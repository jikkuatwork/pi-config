# Apple-Inspired Interaction Design

> Docs-only local adaptation. Follow the UX umbrella core and target-project conventions; load only the references needed for the task. Do not add dependencies or run project tooling without the user’s request and the repository’s permission gates.

This is the upstream author's interpretation of public Apple/WWDC design talks—chiefly *Designing Fluid Interfaces* (WWDC 2018)—translated to web concepts. It is not an Apple specification, endorsement, or substitute for current platform/browser/library documentation. Use the principles when the user asks for this direction; do not copy proprietary visuals or force Apple conventions onto another product.

The through-line for gesture-driven surfaces is continuity: motion starts from the current on-screen value, tracks the user, preserves useful velocity, and can be redirected without a jump. Springs are one effective tool when the installed implementation supports retargeting and velocity handoff.

## The Core Idea

> "When we align the interface to the way we think and move, something magical happens — it stops feeling like a computer and starts feeling like a seamless extension of us."

An interface is fluid when it behaves like the physical world: things respond instantly, move continuously, carry momentum, resist at boundaries, and can be redirected mid-motion. Everything below is a way to get closer to that.

Apple frames design as serving four human needs: **safety/predictability, understanding, achievement, and joy.** Every rule here serves one of them.

## 1. Response — kill latency

The moment lag appears, the feeling of directness "falls off a cliff." Response is the foundation everything else is built on.

- **Show press feedback on pointer-down; commit on activation/release.** Keep cancellation, keyboard activation, and native control behavior intact.
- **Be vigilant about input latency.** Audit unnecessary debounce/timers, transition waits, main-thread work, and legacy touch-delay conditions. Measure the target rather than assuming a universal 300ms delay.
- **Feedback must be continuous *during* the interaction, not just at the end.** For a drag, slider, or drawer, update the UI 1:1 with the pointer the whole way through — never animate only when the gesture completes.

```css
/* Feedback lives on the press, and it's instant */
.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
  transition: transform 100ms ease-out;
}
```

## 2. Direct manipulation — 1:1 tracking

> "Touch and content should move together."

When the user drags something, it must stay glued to the finger — and respect the offset from *where they grabbed it*. Snapping to the element's center on grab breaks the illusion immediately.

- Use Pointer Events with `setPointerCapture` so tracking continues even when the pointer leaves the element's bounds.
- Track a short **velocity/position history** (last few `pointermove` events), not just the current point — you'll need velocity at release.

```js
el.addEventListener('pointerdown', (e) => {
  el.setPointerCapture(e.pointerId);
  const grabOffset = e.clientY - el.getBoundingClientRect().top; // respect where they grabbed
  // ...track position + timestamp history for velocity
});
```

## 3. Interruptibility — the single most important principle

> "The thought and the gesture happen in parallel."

Every user-controlled or rapidly reversible animation should be interruptible and redirectable. A moving sheet/card that can be grabbed again should continue from its current state rather than forcing the user to wait. One-shot decorative/explanatory sequences do not need gesture semantics, but they still must not block interaction.

- **Never lock out input during a transition.**
- **Retarget from the current rendered value.** On interruption, use the live presentation state or a library that preserves it; restarting from a stale logical endpoint can jump.
- **Avoid CSS transitions and `@keyframes` for anything gesture-driven** — they can't be smoothly grabbed and reversed mid-flight. Springs animate from the current value by default, which is exactly what interruption needs.
- **When a gesture reverses, blend velocity — don't hard-cut it.** Replacing one animation with another at a reversal creates a velocity discontinuity, a "brick wall." Spring libraries that carry velocity through a re-target avoid it. (This is what iOS's *additive animations* do natively; on the web, choose a spring library that re-targets from the current velocity.)
- **Decompose 2D motion into independent X and Y springs.** A single spring on a 2D distance desyncs when X and Y have different velocities.

## 4. Behavior over animation — use springs

> "Think of animation as a conversation between you and the object, not something prescribed by the interface."

A pre-scripted, fixed-duration animation can't respond to new input. A spring can — new input just changes the target, and the motion stays continuous. Reach for springs for anything a user can touch.

Apple deliberately replaced the physics triplet (mass/stiffness/damping) with two designer-friendly parameters. Think in these:

- **Damping ratio** — controls overshoot. `1.0` = critically damped, no bounce, smooth settle. `< 1.0` = overshoots and oscillates. Lower = bouncier.
- **Response** — how quickly the value reaches the target, in seconds. Lower = snappier. **This is not "duration"** — a spring has no fixed duration; its settle time emerges from the parameters.

**Defaults:**
- Start most UI at **damping `1.0`** (critically damped) — graceful and non-distracting.
- Add bounce (**damping ~`0.8`**) **only when the gesture itself carried momentum** (a flick, a throw, a drag release). Overshoot on a menu that just faded in feels wrong; overshoot on a card you flicked feels right.

**Values the upstream source reports from Apple examples/talks (verify before translating):**

| Interaction | Damping | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move / reposition (e.g. PiP) | `1.0` | `0.4` |
| Rotation | `0.8` | `0.4` |
| Drawer / sheet | `0.8` | `0.3` |

**Web mapping:** library spring APIs differ. Motion/Framer Motion offers duration/bounce and physical parameter forms, but do not assume they map exactly to Apple's damping/response model. A critically damped/no-overshoot starting point suits many UI surfaces; reserve visible bounce for momentum-driven or deliberately playful interactions.

```js
import { animate } from 'motion';

// Critically damped default (no overshoot)
animate(el, { y: 0 }, { type: 'spring', bounce: 0, duration: 0.4 });

// Momentum interaction — a little bounce, only because a flick preceded it
animate(el, { y: target }, { type: 'spring', bounce: 0.2, duration: 0.4 });
```

## 5. Velocity handoff — the seam between drag and animation

When a gesture ends, hand off a stable estimate of release velocity so there is no obvious seam between tracking and settling. Sampling, filtering, units, and library expectations determine what “same velocity” means in the target.

Pass the pointer's release velocity as the spring's initial velocity. Some spring APIs want **relative** velocity — normalize it by the remaining distance to the target:

```
relativeVelocity = gestureVelocity / (targetValue − currentValue)
```

Example: element at `y=50`, target `y=150` (100px to go), finger moving 50px/s → initial spring velocity = `50 / 100 = 0.5`. Framer Motion / Motion take absolute px/s velocity directly (`velocity` option), so you usually hand it the raw value.

## 6. Momentum projection — animate to where the gesture is *going*

> "Take a small input and make a big output."

For flick-driven controls, consider projecting a resting position from release velocity rather than choosing solely from release position, then snap to the nearest valid target. This can make a flick feel continuous; it is not appropriate for every drag or precision control.

The upstream source attributes this exponential-decay projection form to Apple's *Designing Fluid Interfaces* sample. Treat its units and deceleration constant as a starting model; verify against the target library, sampling method, device scale, and desired snap behavior:

```js
// decelerationRate ≈ 0.998 for normal scroll feel; 0.99 for snappier
function project(initialVelocity /* px/s */, decelerationRate = 0.998) {
  return (initialVelocity / 1000) * decelerationRate / (1 - decelerationRate);
}

const projectedEndpoint = currentPosition + project(releaseVelocity);
const target = nearestSnapPoint(projectedEndpoint);   // choose target from the projection
animateSpringTo(target, { velocity: releaseVelocity }); // then hand off velocity (§5)
```

Do not mix this exponential-decay model with a constant-deceleration formula without reconciling units and behavior. Use whichever model the target platform/library intentionally implements and tune it against real-device gestures.

## 7. Spatial consistency — symmetric paths, anchored origins

> "If something disappears one way, we expect it to emerge from where it came."

- **Preserve a coherent path.** A panel entering from the right will usually dismiss toward the right; use another exit only when the interaction establishes a different destination.
- **Anchor interactions to their source.** A menu, popover, or sheet should originate from the element that triggered it — set `transform-origin` to the trigger, so the spatial relationship between button and content is obvious. (This is the same origin-awareness point as popovers scaling from their trigger, not their center.)
- **Mirror the easing on reversible transitions** so the outbound path matches the return path (use inverse cubic-bézier control points for the two directions).

## 8. Hint in the direction of the gesture

Humans predict a final state from a trajectory. Intermediate motion should telegraph where things are going — Control Center modules "grow up and out toward your finger." Make the in-between frames point at the outcome, not just interpolate blindly to it.

## 9. Rubber-banding — soft boundaries

At an edge, resist progressively instead of stopping hard. A hard stop reads as "frozen"; continuous resistance reads as "responsive, but there's nothing more here." Apply damping that increases the further past the boundary the user drags.

```js
// The further past the bound, the less the element follows — real things slow before they stop
function rubberband(overshoot, dimension, constant = 0.55) {
  return (overshoot * dimension * constant) / (dimension + constant * Math.abs(overshoot));
}
```

## 10. Gesture design details (the "feel" checklist)

- **Tap:** highlight on touch-*down* (instant), commit on touch-*up*. Add ~10px of hysteresis/hit padding around the target, and allow cancel-by-dragging-away and back.
- **Drag/swipe:** require a small movement threshold (hysteresis, ~10px) before committing to a direction, then track 1:1.
- **Detect all plausible gestures in parallel from the first move**, then confidently cancel the losers once intent is clear. Avoid recognizers that only report a *final* state (`swipeleft`-type events) — they throw away the continuous tracking you need for feedback.
- **Minimize disambiguation delays.** Double-tap detection unavoidably delays single taps; only pay that cost where double-tap truly exists.

## 11. Frame-level smoothness

Smoothness is about *what's in the frames*, not just the frame rate.

- Keep the per-frame positional change below the perception threshold to avoid strobing.
- For very fast motion, a subtle **motion blur / stretch** encodes speed and reads better than a hard sharp streak.
- `requestAnimationFrame` is the web's display-synced clock (Apple uses `CADisplayLink`). Animate only compositor-friendly properties — `transform` and `opacity` — and hint with `will-change` where motion is imminent.

## 12. Materials & depth — translucency conveys hierarchy

Apple often uses translucent materials to communicate floating hierarchy. On the web, `backdrop-filter` can approximate that direction, but it has contrast, transparency-preference, performance, and browser/device costs. Use it only when it serves hierarchy and test an opaque fallback.

- **Use translucent nav/toolbars/sheets only when floating hierarchy is part of the direction.** Provide an opaque fallback and ensure scrolling content stays readable underneath.
- **Material weight can encode hierarchy:** heavier/opaquer surfaces may separate structural regions while lighter materials can float controls. Avoid stacking translucent layers when contrast becomes unpredictable.
- **Scale material treatment deliberately:** a larger surface may need more separation, but stronger blur/shadow is not automatically better; profile and test context.
- **Dim to focus, separate to keep flow.** A modal task pairs the surface with a dimming scrim and pushes the background back/down. A parallel, non-blocking panel uses translucency and offset *without* a scrim so the flow isn't broken. For stacked sheets, progressively dim and push back each parent layer.
- **Vibrancy keeps text legible over changing backgrounds.** Over blurred/translucent surfaces, don't use flat gray text — use higher-contrast, slightly heavier weight, and a small letter-spacing bump. Put color on a solid layer, not the translucent foreground.
- **Scroll edge effects, not hard dividers.** Instead of a 1px border under a sticky header, fade a small blur/gradient mask where content meets floating chrome — only where floating UI actually overlaps content.
- **Materialize, don't just fade.** For glass/blur surfaces, animate blur radius and scale together on enter/exit, so the surface reads as a real material arriving rather than a plain opacity fade.

```css
.toolbar {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
  border-top: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4); /* bright top edge = light catching the material */
}
```

## 13. Multimodal feedback — motion + sound + haptics

Three rules for combining senses (from *Designing Audio-Haptic Experiences*):

1. **Causality** — it must be obvious what caused the feedback. Trigger it on the actual causal event (the toggle flipping, the item snapping home), and match its character to the action's physicality.
2. **Harmony** — visual, sound, and supported haptic feedback should be perceptually synchronized. Browser scheduling and hardware vary, so measure noticeable lag rather than promising literal same-frame delivery.
3. **Utility** — add feedback only where it earns its place. Reserve sound or supported haptics for meaningful moments, respect user/browser/platform controls, and never rely on them as the sole cue. Web vibration support and permission/UX expectations vary.

## 14. Reduced motion & accessibility

Reduced motion doesn't mean *no* feedback — it means a gentler, non-vestibular equivalent. Respond to three independent signals and bake them into your components:

- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`** — replace slides/springs/parallax with short opacity **cross-fades or static transitions**. Drop elastic/overshoot. Keep opacity/color changes that aid comprehension.
- **Reduced transparency preference where supported** — make translucent surfaces more opaque/solid and drop blur. Treat `prefers-reduced-transparency` as progressive because browser support varies; always provide a robust base surface.
- **`prefers-contrast: more`** — near-solid backgrounds with a defined, contrasting border.

Also avoid full-viewport moving backgrounds, slow looping oscillations, and abrupt brightness jumps. Do not make large moving content translucent by default; first remove/reduce the movement, then test any opacity treatment for readability and flashing/contrast effects.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .sheet { transition: opacity 200ms ease; transform: none !important; }
}
@media (prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce) {
  .toolbar { background: white; backdrop-filter: none; }
}
```

## 15. Typography — optical sizing, tracking, leading

Apple designs type to change shape with size; the same discipline applies on the web. (From *The Details of UI Typography*, WWDC 2020.)

- **Evaluate tracking by size and face.** Large display text often benefits from tighter tracking and tiny uppercase labels may need more, but many fonts already supply good spacing. Do not add overrides without inspecting the actual typeface.
- **Leading (line-height) tracks size inversely.** Tight on large headings, looser on body copy. Increase it for scripts with tall ascenders/descenders; tighten it for dense, information-heavy UI.
- **Build hierarchy from weight + size + leading as a set,** not size alone. Emphasize with weight — it adds presence without taking more space.
- **Respect the user's text-size setting** (Dynamic Type). Scale layout *with* the text — spacing in `rem`/`em`, not fixed px — so a larger font doesn't break the layout.
- Prefer the product's established type system. A platform system stack is a strong default for an Apple-inspired web surface, but it does not replace brand and cross-platform requirements. Route detailed decisions to the typography module.

```css
:root { font: 100%/1.5 system-ui, sans-serif; } /* body: system font, comfortable leading */

.display {
  font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4rem);
  line-height: 1.05;        /* tight leading for large text */
  letter-spacing: -0.02em;  /* negative tracking as it grows */
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
}
```

## 16. Design foundations — the eight principles

The motion and craft above serve Apple's eight design principles (*Principles of Great Design*, WWDC 2026). Use these as the names you reason with:

1. **Purpose.** Make with intention; decide what *not* to build. Every feature asks for the user's time, attention, and trust — spend that budget only where it pays off.
2. **Agency.** Keep people in control: offer choices, don't force a single path. Back it with forgiveness — easy undo for slips, a confirmation dialog only for genuinely destructive, irreversible actions (use sparingly; overusing it trains people to click through).
3. **Responsibility.** Act in the user's interest. Privacy: ask at the right moment, only for what's needed, transparently. Safety: anticipate misuse and harm — especially with AI (an allergy-aware recipe app must not suggest a harmful ingredient). Add previews, confirmations, disclaimers; cut a feature whose risk outweighs its value.
4. **Familiarity.** Build on what people already know. Use metaphors that are neither too literal nor too abstract (a trash can means delete), and honor their physics. Be consistent: things that look the same must behave the same and live in the same place (close is always top-left on macOS) so people can predict what happens next. Only break a familiar pattern if you can prove it's better — then test it, don't assume.
5. **Flexibility.** Design for different contexts, devices, and the full range of abilities. Adapt to the platform (iPhone = quick touch; desktop = deep workflows with precise pointer control) and to the situation. Design inclusively (age, language, expertise, accessibility). When no single layout fits everyone, let people personalize — rearrange controls, hide what they don't use.
6. **Simplicity — not minimalism.** Strip the unnecessary so the core purpose shines; burying everything in one place looks minimal but isn't simple. Be concise (plain language, no jargon, fewer steps) and clear (use hierarchy — order, spacing, contrast — so the most important thing is the most obvious). Every element earns its place; sometimes *adding* context simplifies (a video scrubber that shows time remaining). Show the common path first, advanced options one level deeper.
7. **Craft.** Uncompromising attention to detail builds trust. Beautiful typography, colors that adapt to light/dark, clear iconography, and responsive animations that give immediate, natural feedback. Nothing is random — every spacing, timing, and alignment value is a deliberate choice you can defend. Jittery scroll, misaligned icons, and layouts that break on rotation read as carelessness. Craft needs iteration and longevity — keep evolving the design as features and hardware change.
8. **Delight.** The result of getting the other seven right, not confetti tacked on top. Decide the emotion you want people to feel (calm, confident, excited) and reinforce it in every decision.

Tactical rules that serve these:

- **Feedback comes in four kinds:** status, completion, warning, error. Confirm meaningful actions, expose ongoing status, warn before problems, and validate at a useful time (often blur/submit with inline association), not with noisy premature errors.
- **Wayfinding.** Every screen should answer: Where am I? Where can I go? What's there? How do I get out? Never trap the user.
- **Grouping & mapping.** Proximity implies relationship; place a control near what it affects and arrange controls to mirror what they change. If you need a label to explain a control, the mapping is weak.
- **Direct, specific labels beat safe generic ones.** Name nav items for their contents ("Progress", "Library"), not vague umbrellas ("Home"). Specificity creates predictability.

## 17. Process

- **Prototype interactively — an interactive demo is worth "a million static designs."** You discover the interface by building and playing with it; a working prototype also sets a concrete bar that prevents a mediocre final implementation.
- **Design interaction and visuals together.** "You shouldn't be able to tell where one ends and the other begins." Motion is not a layer added after the pixels.
- **Test with real people in real context**, and review motion with fresh eyes — play it in slow motion / frame-by-frame to catch what's invisible at full speed.
